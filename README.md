this started out as a quick code on Sololearn. <br>
Someway somehow I decided to take it further. <br>
The purpose was to find a way to apply my knowledge of html,css and js, to make the concepts, patterns and basic syntax to stick.<br>
Looking at the project, I did achieve my goal at the time; I used it all in this one project;
data-attr, new css properties, es6+ rest & spread etc <br><br>
the greatest thing that came out of this was `GIT`: <br>
&emsp; I started using it during `v2.5+`. by the time i was done with v3, I realized how I poorly I used git and immediately knew how better to use it<br>
&emsp; Cos what I did was basically underestimating git and not utilizing the very reason it exists, as a `version control manager`. <br>
&emsp; I only used it as a better undo button, I would create a new folder for the next version. Lol, I know better now :)
